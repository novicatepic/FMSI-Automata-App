# Automata Project


The concept behind this application is to create a library designed for working with regular languages. Regular languages are represented using finite automata (DFA and Epsilon NFA). The implemented functionalities encompass:

-Running finite automata generated by library users.
-Constructing unions, intersections, differences, concatenations, and complements between languages. Additionally, applying the Kleene star operation to languages, with the capability to chain these operations.
-Determining the shortest and longest words within a language, and assessing whether a language is finite or not.
-Minimizing the number of states in a DFA.
-Converting Epsilon NFA to DFA, and transforming regular expressions into finite automata.
-Comparing representations of regular languages, which includes regular expressions, using language equality as the parameter for comparison.

A second application specified in this document aims to enable users to verify whether given strings belong to the represented language. For each regular language, lexical analysis is required to identify any lexical errors. If such errors exist, users should be informed about the quantity of errors present in the specific specification.

Develop an application that generates programming code capable of simulating a state machine based on a DFA specification. Users of the generated code can define reactions for each state. The term "events" refers to actions related to either entering or exiting a state. The generated code should allow users to define event reactions for each symbol within the alphabet. Furthermore, the ability to chain these reactions based on specific events is essential.

In addition to these requirements, the code should be thoroughly commented, and the asymptotic complexity of the algorithms should be documented. Rigorous unit testing must be conducted for each functionality incorporated in these applications.

These applications are developed in C# and are designed as console applications.
